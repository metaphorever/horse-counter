### Phase 0 — Foundations · ✅ closed

VPS provisioning, SQLite schema, short-code permalinks, Clerk auth, localStorage→account sync, ToS/Privacy/Data-Deletion pages. Site has its shell.

### Phase 1 — MVP soft launch · 🟡 mid-flight

**Shipped:**
- 1.1 Top-level nav + IA
- 1.2 Editor pain-fix: chip menu + drag + pasture backend
- 1.3 Tag taxonomy + attribution + trust scaffold
- 1.5 Poem permalink renderer + Open Graph
- 1.6 Two-mode poem renderer (plain / pasture)
- 1.22 Attribution footer + Ko-fi support
- Nav/footer chrome polish (2026-05-16)
- **1.6.1 Hotfix — Restore submission flow end-to-end** (2026-05-18) — `init_db()` at app startup, `/browse` poem index stub, mobile chip touch-drag fix
- **1.7 Horse popover in pasture mode** (2026-05-18) — horse_occurrences/pasture_horses/saved_horses tables, popover with save/pasture/poems-featuring, focus-trapped + ESC/outside-click dismiss, logged-out prompts, `/p/<short>` now renders full permalink template
- **1.8 Featured / Browse / Random** ✅ — two-tier tag system (public + admin-only `tag_categories.admin_only`), `featured_sections` table, `/browse` with pagination/sort/tag-filter/attribution-filter, `/random` redirect, `/featured` page driven by admin-curated sections, `/admin/featured` management page, per-poem admin tag editor on poem page. Built out of order across earlier phases; verified working by Clover (2026-05-21).
- **1.9 Empty-line warning at publish** ✅ — mid-poem empty line detection at submit time; modal warning with "Remove empty lines" / "Keep them" choice; "Remember my choice" checkbox persists preference to localStorage (anonymous) or `/me/preferences` (logged-in). Verified by Clover.
- **1.10 Export: copy as text / HTML / .txt** ✅ (2026-05-18) — three buttons in the poem footer: copy plain text (horse names), copy HTML chip markup, download .txt with title/attribution/URL header. All client-side.
- **1.11 Plain-text print stylesheet** ✅ (2026-05-19) — `@media print` stylesheet: Smokum corner-logo masthead, Abril Fatface title, IM Fell English body in small-caps, Playfair Display SC attribution/tags, turnover (hanging) indent on poem lines, thin underline separating horse names, colophon note + permalink. New fonts loaded site-wide as shared toolbox for future web use. Verified by Clover.
- **1.25 Nav / IA polish** ✅ (2026-05-19) — labels: "Drafts", "My Poems"; removed "Home" nav item; Featured/Browse/Random promoted to top-level; `/` redirects to `/featured`.
- **1.26 Horse search area rework** ✅ (2026-05-19) — short names link → button; random horse button in search panel; pasture horses button with pagination; compact help/how-to button.
- **1.27 Save draft from poem builder** ✅ (2026-05-19) — Save Draft button + modal; draft-centric stable model; SQLite-backed drafts with stable_json + full metadata; `/me/drafts` live page; horse popover gains "Add to draft stable" picker; anon `horse-draft` localStorage shape with migration; `syncLocalToAccount` saves anon draft on first login. Removes `stable_horses` table + `/me/stable/*` routes.
- **1.28 Draft polish: popover quick-create + editor auto-save redesign** ✅ (2026-05-20) — Popover: 0-draft → inline quick-create form; 1+-draft → list + "Add to new draft ▸" expander. Editor: page-load picker when 1+ drafts; auto-save (immediate on add/remove, 7s debounced on drag); "Currently editing [NAME] [Change Draft ▾]" strip; renamed buttons (Clear Stable / Clear Poem / Edit Details / Post Poem); clear dialogs with destination options. PR #43 + hotfix PR #44 (admin user fix). Holds 1–9 verified by Clover (2026-05-21); hold 10 (anon flow) deferred.
- **1.16 RSS feed** ✅ (2026-05-21) — shipped in PR #45 alongside 1.17 + 1.21
- **1.17 Rate limiting** ✅ (2026-05-21) — shipped in PR #45 alongside 1.16 + 1.21
- **1.21 Soft sign-in prompts** ✅ (2026-05-21) — shipped in PR #45 alongside 1.16 + 1.17
- **1.14 Report button + report queue** ✅ (2026-05-21, verified) — report modal on poem permalink; `reports` table; `/admin/reports` queue with action/dismiss; thank-you auto-dismisses after 15s
- **1.15 Poet profile `/u/<slug>`** ✅ (2026-05-21, verified) — full profile with bio poem picker, published poems list, links; `/me/profile` edit page; `bio_poem_id` column on users
- **1.19 Save (Blue Ribbon) + Pasture collections** ✅ (2026-05-21, verified) — `saved_poems` table; ribbon button on poem permalink; `/me/saved-poems`, `/me/saved-horses`, `/me/pasture` list pages

**Remaining (rough order):**
- **1.12 Three-mode display system** ✅ (2026-05-23, verified) — all six steps live + verified by Clover. Admin tag editor uses old styles on the inverted Fancy note (deferred to admin cleanup); Plain note background absence is expected behavior. Replaces binary plain/pasture with three descriptively-named modes:
  - **Fancy** — all the fancy styles: full body-part chips, coats, shimmer; field *is* the surface; text/UI floats on grass separated by a contrasting outline (color TBD at prototype); non-horse text de-emphasized; UI ornate. (Was internally "pasture" — renaming to Fancy frees "Pasture" to mean only the place/collection.)
  - **Plain** — functional CSS only: colored chips + shimmer, **no body parts**; field is decorative backdrop; content in count-page-style pinned note-boxes; bumped text/touch targets.
  - **Reader** — text-only, minimal: off-white print-stylesheet aesthetic on screen (1.11 font toolbox); woodprint button borders; no field.
  - **Architecture (settled):** *full site-wide skin, bounded* — chrome (nav/footer/bg) skins on every page; display/reading surfaces fully follow the mode; **workhorse guts stay utilitarian** (editor canvas, admin, account forms, count, legal — editor chips never get body parts). Resolution is **server-emitted**: logged-in → DB pref, anon → `view_mode` cookie, no-cookie default → **Fancy**; no JS needed to apply the skin (closes the client-side-resolution open design question). **Motion decoupled from mode** — `prefers-reduced-motion` suppresses animation within the active mode rather than switching modes. Mode class moves from per-container to body-level; 1.29 macros stay the single render source; per-container hardcoded modes removed (collections/bio follow site mode); dead `.poem-pasture-view` CSS deleted.
  - **Picker:** one control — prominent non-modal first-run strip under the nav (`[Fancy] [Plain] [Reader]`, Fancy highlighted) on display surfaces; absence of the cookie *is* the fresh-user signal; any pick/dismiss writes the cookie and collapses it to a compact `⊙ Fancy ▾` control in the nav (mirrored in account prefs).
  - **Prototype-first (commit only after Clover reviews rendered options):** Fancy outline color + non-horse de-emphasis; Reader text styling + woodprint borders; Fancy mobile (floating text on narrow viewport).
  - **Collections are poems:** My Pasture, Saved Horses, and bio poems render through the poem renderer and follow the active mode — no separate collection display treatment (a list of horses *is* a poem). In Reader mode a collection is a typographic list-poem of names.
  - **Deferred out of 1.12:** walk-cycle animation (Fancy ships static), ambient background horses (stays Phase 2).
  - **Absorbs from style pass:** plain-mode collection chips transparent-to-grass; fancy-mode bio poem transparent-to-grass (note-bg only in Plain).
  - **Build order:** ✅ 1) infrastructure → ✅ 2) picker → ✅ 3) Plain skin → ✅ 4) Fancy skin "field-is-surface", Variant C ink-on-field + gold edge → ✅ 5) Reader skin (print aesthetic on screen, W1 woodprint buttons) → ✅ 6) Fancy mobile. All six built, reviewed, and verified live. Chip size/font harmonisation deferred to the style/font pass. `[opus · high]`
- **1.13 Admin moderation queue overhaul** ✅ (2026-05-22, verified) — chip render in queue cards; submitter tags as removable chips by default with "Edit tags" toggle for full picker; publish explicitly sets admin's tag selection; reviewer ID wired to Clerk user; full preview link per card
- **1.13.1 Trust score system** ✅ (2026-05-24, PR #62) — Pairs with 1.13. Integer trust score per user (column on `users`), starts at 0 for new accounts and anonymous/pseudonymous. Scoring: +1 per admin-approved poem where no tag edits were made; -1 per poem where admin edited tags before/during approval. Admin can manually override score from the user page. Admin sets per-action thresholds stored in DB (not hardcoded), e.g. `auto_post_threshold = N` → users with trust ≥ N bypass the queue and post instantly. Default threshold 0 = open posting for new/anon users; raising it gates newcomers when abuse spikes. Enables: "let loyal Tumblr fans post freely while blocking bad actors" without a code deploy. Depends on 1.13 (queue overhaul ships the approval/edit event hooks needed to update scores). Current behavior (admin = instant, everyone else = queue) is the threshold-0 / threshold-∞ special case and does not need to change until this ships.
- ~~1.18 One-shot import of legacy data~~ — **STRUCK 2026-05-17.** Fresh launch instead; see `spec/product.md` "Permanently out of scope." Old poems stay on Tumblr / wherever they already are; nothing imported into the new explicit-ToS environment.
- **1.20 Cross-post queue** ✅ (2026-05-24, PR #69) — admin-flagged cross-post queue with Tumblr connector. Live verification by Clover not yet logged.
- **1.23 GitHub Actions deploy** ✅ (2026-05-22, verified) — `appleboy/ssh-action`; git pull + uv pip install + systemctl --user restart on every push to master
- 1.24 DNS cutover + PA shutdown `[haiku · low — owner action]`
- **1.4 Admin tag management** ✅ (2026-05-22, verified) — pending tag review + approve/reject; tag rename/deactivate/safe-delete; category rename/safe-delete; unified view at `/admin/featured`
- **1.29 DRY poem renderer** ✅ (2026-05-23, verified) — `templates/macros.html` with `render_chip(h, linked)` and `render_poem(lines, line_class, linked)`; wired into poem.html, poem_queue.html, user_profile.html, my_pasture.html, saved_horses.html; routes enrich coat/rev/is_famous before render; turnover indent on screen `.poem-line-out` (plain mode only); broadened `[data-view-mode='pasture']` CSS selector; global view-mode preference propagation via base.html script.
- **Style pass session** — focused styling session before beta (fancy/plain/high-contrast/typography-only print modes side-by-side; restore decorated editor chips; **wandering pasture/saved-horses layout**: horse chips scattered at random 2D positions with sort modes — date added / alphabetical / random / wandering; all non-wandering modes use column layout; fix green font color on `/me/saved-horses` and `/me/pasture`; bio poem on `/u/<slug>` should render with full poem styles consistent with user display settings; **enlarge Fancy chips + harmonise the chip font with the display type** — chip size and chip font are one decision, deferred here from 1.12 step 6, where chips stayed Courier-Prime monospace at current scale; Clover wants them larger and "playing nice with the fancy fonts" — pairs with the SVG-chip backlog item). Pre-beta, not mid-feature. **Note:** the two mode-rendering bugs formerly listed here — plain-mode collection chips should be transparent-to-grass, and fancy-mode bio poem should be transparent-to-grass (note-bg only in Plain) — moved into **1.12**, which rebuilds the mode system anyway.

### Phase 2 — Beta & feedback · ⏳ pending soft launch

Editor UX rethink (opus), explicit/mature display, image-card export, fancy broadsheet print, horsified HTML embed, oEmbed, per-horse PQ scrape (Cloudflare-aware), real coat colors, pasture-search mode, per-horse/per-tag browse pages, FTS5 search, site-popularity stats, ambient field horses, Bluesky/Mastodon/Threads/X connectors, Tumblr theme port, three-concept disambiguation pass.

### Phase 3 — Growth · ⏳ pending sustained traffic

Exquisite corpse mode, Hall of Fame (curated + popular), public read API + OpenAPI, horse-database public download, independent VPS migration.

### Phase 4 — Monetization · ⏳ pending revenue threshold

Ko-fi tip-jar polish, Carbon-style static ads, ad-free supporter keys, supporter cosmetic flair, lawyer review, merch/anthology exploration.

## Backlog

Surfaced items not yet committed to a phase. Promote to a phase when ready.

- ~~**Collection pages render and behave fully as poems**~~ ✅ **Shipped 2026-05-24** — horse popover extracted to `_horse_popover.html` shared include; pasture + saved-horses pages wire the same popover as poem permalinks (ribbon, pasture toggle, draft picker, poems-featuring); removing a horse from pasture removes its chip from the DOM; unsaving from saved-horses removes its chip. Plain-mode cream note box added for collection pages. Bio poem chips on `/u/<slug>` wired. Print masthead updated to SVG logo. `.collection-chip-remove` hover-button approach removed. **Deferred to Phase 2:** wandering/random-scatter layout. Needs live testing on poet.horse (see holds).
- **Editor button layout tweaks** — "Wrangle a Poem" page: (1) Clear Poem button should match Clear Stable styling (danger-colored, wide, short); (2) Post Poem and Edit Details buttons should move below the poem area under the draft picker; (3) "Poem" and "Stable" section labels should be the same font size. Slot into the pre-beta style pass session.
- **Tumblr post CSS desync** — new posts lose chip structural styling because Tumblr appears to strip `class` attributes; `--bg`/`--fg` inlined vars survive but `.horse-link` body-shape rules don't. Fix path: data-attribute selectors or inlined structural CSS. Deprioritized — most Tumblr viewers use dashboard (CSS stripped there anyway). Revisit after website CSS is locked. (Originally tracked in pre-migration TODO.md.)
- **Link validator** for `short-names-validation.html` and eventually the full dictionary — Cloudflare-aware Playwright session, polite rate-limit, page-content check for "not found", outputs annotated HTML or `data/link_validation.json`. Pilot with the short-names list (1362 horses). (Originally TODO.md.)
- **Sync `data/horse_overrides.json` from production back to git** — canonical overrides file lives on the server and gets edited in prod; doesn't automatically flow back. Options: one-click admin export, cron commit, or deploy-time pull-first hook. (Originally TODO.md.)
- **Ambient background horses** — a few chips in the SVG grass behind working areas (z-indexed so they never overlap UI); bonus walk-cycle. Subset of Phase 2.13. (Originally TODO.md.)
- **Fancy-mode motion + roaming sub-toggles** (Clover, 2026-05-23 — clarity on the long-mooted animation/random-placement idea; **far roadmap, do not pull forward**). Two second-level toggles that appear **only in Fancy mode**:
  - **Animation on/off** — *deliberately* low-fi: a little jiggle, or a short (<4-frame?) cycle. The aesthetic target is "a little bit of jankiness if it's charming," **not** slick animation. Pick the technical approach for compatibility/reach (CSS steps() sprite-ish cycle vs transform keyframes vs tiny SVG SMIL — TBD). Honors the existing motion-decoupling rule (1.12): reduced-motion suppresses it.
  - **Roaming** — OFF by default (horses stand in poem formation). When on, a speed setting (slow/medium/fast, possibly horse terms — trot/canter/gallop; exact set + order TBD) makes the horses **slowly disperse and wander the field** like they're grazing. With enough time a poem could theoretically reform into a new arrangement. Default stays static formation; this is strictly opt-in. **Strange-attractor / fancy pathfinding is explicitly out** of first cut — simple random drift first; do not get sidetracked into modeling.
  - Builds on the deferred 1.12 walk-cycle + the ambient-horses entry above; revisit alongside those in Phase 2.13. Motion belongs to the **display surface**, not the editor (UI-vs-display commitment).
- **SVG coat pattern overlays** (Clover, 2026-05-23) — post SVG-chip-art-system: once chips are SVG, use `<pattern>` fills for natural mottled coat colouring (dappling, roan speckle, paint patchwork, etc.) instead of flat fill colours. Pairs with the SVG chip art system — do not pull forward before that lands.
- **Per-display-mode editor styles** (Clover, 2026-05-23) — long-term: each of the three display modes (Fancy/Plain/Reader) could eventually have its own editor treatment with appropriate decoration. Each would need substantial individual attention. The current utilitarian editor is intentionally preserved as the stable default; this is a future opt-in project, not a regression.
- **SVG chip art system** (Clover, 2026-05-23 — raised during 1.12 step-6; **Phase 2, pair with walk-cycle/animation above**) — replace the CSS/Unicode "found-objects" chip (head = `♞` glyph, tail = `∫` glyph, legs = gradient slices, box = div) with custom **front + back SVG caps and a flexible middle** holding the name (a 9-slice / stretchable-sprite pattern). Why: (1) cross-platform consistency — the `♞`/`∫` glyphs are the real drift across OS/browser/font, and they're the most visually defining parts; (2) **motion** — gradient-slice legs cannot do a convincing walk-cycle, SVG path groups can, so this is the enabling tech for the roaming/animation ambitions, not just polish. Charm is preserved by *deliberately crude/naive* art ("charming jank"), not by keeping Unicode — web1 soul is an art-direction choice. The `render_chip` macro already isolates the chip, so the swap is contained behind one render source and coat-colouring carries over via `fill`/CSS vars ("refine once, correct everywhere" already holds) — which is exactly why deferring costs nothing. Same conversation as "enlarge chips + chip font" in the style pass; the art effort (Clover draws) + the flexible-box layout problem + its own prototype gate live here.
- **Dark mode** (Clover, 2026-05-23 — surfaced during 1.12 step-4 colour review; backlog) — the inverted tan-on-dark-brown "note" palette landed for the Fancy tags/footer clusters reads as a natural dark-mode seed. Possible future `prefers-color-scheme` / explicit-toggle dark theme reusing that palette. Not near-term; well outside 1.12.
- **Auth redirect: return-to-origin + modal sign-in** — after sign-in/account creation, user should land back where they were (e.g. mid-poem in the editor) rather than the homepage. Standard `?next=` pattern: stash the destination URL before redirecting to sign-in, restore it after Clerk verify completes. Pair with a modal sign-in flow so auth doesn't break editor state at all. Belongs in a Clerk-focused session; noted 2026-05-19 as something that should have been handled during Phase 0 Clerk integration.
- **Follow other posters** — low-key social-graph primitive: follow a poet, see a feed of their published poems. No DMs, no friend requests, no mutual handshake. Surfaced during 2026-05-17 product-spec interview as a net addition to scope.
- **Profile bios made of horses** — required: profile bios must obey the constraint too. On-brand enforcement of the site's central rule. Pair with 1.15 (poet profiles).
- **Profile external links** — short list of links on a profile to personal sites / social platforms / contact methods. Explicit answer to "no DMs on poet.horse" — take connection off-platform. Pair with 1.15.
- **"Response to" attribution variant** — extend the Phase 1.5 attribution flag (`inspired_by_text` / `inspired_by_url`) so the URL can point at a poet.horse permalink and the UI reads as a reply rather than an external citation. Tentative — "fun and pretty low cost to build in with the current structure but it doesn't need to block anything currently in dev." Doesn't bump 1.7–1.21.
- **Remove PIN admin auth** — Clover, 2026-05-17: *"PIN can be pruned out whenever now that Clerk is online."* Replace the dual-auth surface (`app.py:122` `_is_admin()`) with a single Clerk-only role check. Resolves the "Clerk role and PIN admin are independent" open design question. Coordinate with: adding admin-promotion UI so Clerk users can be elevated without DB surgery.
- **Remove legacy JSON submission backend** — Clover, 2026-05-17: *"same with old json submission path."* Delete `submissions.py` (JSON queue) and the associated admin surfaces (`/submissions`, `/queue`, etc.); SQLite-backed poem submissions become the only path. Resolves the "Dual submission backends" open design question. Order: do this after 1.13 (admin moderation queue overhaul) which already plans the new poem-first review UI.
- **Web typography pass using print font toolbox** — 1.11 loaded Smokum, Abril Fatface, IM Fell English, and Playfair Display SC site-wide. Candidate uses on screen: Abril Fatface for nav/site identity elements; IM Fell English for plain-mode poem body; Playfair Display SC for attribution lines. Slot into the pre-beta style pass session — don't apply piecemeal.
- **Fancy picket fence print ornament** — a small centered fence vignette (embellished picket tips, a few posts wide) used as a decorative separator in the Phase 2 Victorian broadsheet print mode. Not a full-width repeating rule — a single ornamental cut, like a printer's fleuron. Held out of the plain-text print stylesheet (1.11) deliberately: wrong register there. Belongs in the broadsheet mode where the decorative weight is matched throughout.
- **Per-poem line alignment + freeform positioning** — poet-controlled display formatting for artistic intent. Two parts: (1) per-line or per-poem alignment toggle (left / center / right), needed for concrete poetry where shape is meaning; (2) freeform mode that records relative pixel positions per horse, enabling arbitrary visual layouts. Both touch `lines_json` shape and the renderer. The freeform mode is a significant data model change and a new editing paradigm. Slot near or after Phase 2 editor rethink (2.1). Do not conflate with the Phase 1.9 empty-line warning — that's a publish-time data hygiene check; this is a display/authorship feature.
- ~~**SVG logo (`poet-horse.svg`) in web and print**~~ ✅ **Shipped 2026-05-24** — nav already used SVG (pre-existing); print masthead in `poem.html` + `print.css` updated to `<img class="print-masthead-logo">` at 26pt height, replacing Smokum text.
- **Saved Horses nav button** — add a "Saved Horses" button next to Short Names / Random / My Pasture in the horse search area; logged-in only; loads user's saved horses. Slot into 1.29 or style pass.
- **Pending poems visible to author** — after submitting a poem, users have no way to see it while it's under review. Logged-in authors should be able to see their own `status='submitted'` poems (e.g. on `/me/published` or a new `/me/pending` tab). Small data-model query; surface TBD.
- **Admin hidden poems view** — admin can hide poems but has no way to see or manage them afterwards. Need a `/admin/hidden-poems` page (or a toggle on `/admin/poem-queue`) listing all `status='hidden'` poems with unhide/delete actions. Pair with the admin poem queue session.
- **Auto-hide on report / trust score** — when a report is submitted, optionally auto-hide the poem based on: (1) reporter trust score, (2) number of reports on the poem, or (3) author trust score falling below a threshold. Design TBD — at minimum needs a flag on the report that triggered auto-hide so admin knows the context. Coordinate with the reports/moderation workflow.
- ~~**Horses from published poems auto-added to pasture**~~ ✅ **Shipped 2026-05-24** — `_auto_pasture_from_lines()` called on both the bypass-queue publish path and the admin approval path; idempotent via INSERT OR IGNORE.
- ~~**Tags in Edit Details not carried to Post Poem**~~ ✅ **Resolved 2026-05-24** — `openModal()` now pre-populates title, After (inspired_by text/url), and tags from `currentDraftMeta` for logged-in users instead of clearing them on every open. The broader "unify into one flow with different terminal actions (save draft / post)" idea remains a future UX consideration but the immediate data-loss bug is fixed.
- **Horse/word ratio browse filter** — `compute_poem_stats` currently reports `horse_density: 100.0` (always 100%, useless). Replace with `horse_ratio`: `horse_count / sum(len(name.split()) for each horse)` — i.e. 1.0 for all-1-word names, 0.5 for all-2-word names, etc. Named "compactness" or "density" in the UI. Store as a float column on `poems` at publish time (computed from `lines_json`) so it is indexable for `/browse` range filters. Remove `horse_density` from `compute_poem_stats` or repurpose it. Surfaced 2026-05-24.
- **Suggested (new) tags not surfaced in mod queue** — 1.13 shows existing pending tags as chips in the queue card, but user-proposed new tag names are not surfaced. Admin should see proposed new tags alongside the poem and be able to approve the tag and the poem together. Gap in 1.13.
- **Admin featured sections mobile polish** (2026-05-24) — tag taxonomy upgraded to click-to-edit list (PR #68); featured sections table still has squashed columns on mobile. Low priority. Revisit if the page sees heavy use.
- **Moderator role** (Clover, 2026-05-24 — deferred to post-beta) — a role that can approve/reject poems and act on reports, but cannot manage featured sections, tags, user trust scores, account actions, or dictionary overrides. The `role` column on `users` is already the right hook; no implementation until post-beta volume demands it.
- **Featured page: mixed section types** (Clover, 2026-05-23) — extend the Phase 1.8 `featured_sections` system so the `/featured` page can render an **arbitrary mix** of two block types: (a) a **list of poems** (title + metadata only, the current behavior) and (b) a **single poem showcased in full inline** on the page (rendered through the poem renderer / current display mode). Admin picks the block type per section in `/admin/featured`; order is arbitrary so a curated page can interleave lists and full showcases. Touches the `featured_sections` schema (add a section-type/`render` column), the `/featured` template, and the admin management UI. Promote to a phase when ready.
- **Site root = a real home/landing page** (Clover, 2026-05-23 — *long-term; `/featured` is fine for now*) — `/` currently redirects to `/featured` (1.25). Long-term, make site root a **distinct welcome page**, separate from Featured: a short intro / explanation / "welcome to my…" blurb, a **"here's what you can do" block with large accessible on-page nav buttons** (so visitors can click Home → Browse without touching the menu), *and* room to surface a handful of featured elements. Featured stays focused (just poem lists / full showcases); Home is the friendly front door. Pairs naturally with the mixed-section work above. Not near-term.

## Open design questions

Resolve before the relevant phase starts.

- **In-pasture horse interaction details** — popover shape confirmed (name, link, poems-featuring, add-to-pasture, ribbon-save). Exact transition / placement / dismissal behavior is a Phase 1.7 design call.
- **Editor chip interactions (one-page builder)** — drag-primary vs click-primary vs hybrid for the Phase 2 rethink. Phase 1.2 shipped a hybrid pain-fix; Phase 2.1 is the full redesign with prototype routes.
- **Image-card export technique** — Phase 2.3 needs an owner pick between `html2canvas` client-side and a server-side Playwright render.

### Surfaced by migration audit (2026-05-17)

These came out of the step-5 audit of the current codebase. They're not bugs to fix this session — they're decisions or design conversations to have before the relevant phase.

- **Schema migrations are unversioned and run every boot.** `db/seed.py:apply_migrations()` uses `PRAGMA table_info` guards. Works at current scale; will hurt if a Phase 2 migration is expensive (e.g. FTS5 indexing all poems). Decide: introduce a version table / alembic / nothing-yet — before Phase 2 starts.
- **Dual submission backends.** ~~Should consolidate before Phase 1.8.~~ **Resolved 2026-05-17:** legacy JSON path scheduled for removal — see backlog entry "Remove legacy JSON submission backend." SQLite becomes the only submission path.
- ~~**View-mode resolution runs client-side.**~~ **Resolved Phase 1.12 (2026-05-23):** resolution moved server-side (signed-in DB pref → `view_mode` cookie → default `fancy`), emitted as a `body.view-<mode>` class on first paint — works with JS disabled. Reduced-motion now suppresses animation within the active mode rather than switching modes.
- **Datamuse API has no graceful degradation.** `poetry.py` fetches rhymes/synonyms over the network with an in-memory cache only; on outage or rate-limit the user sees "no results" silently. Decide: stale-cache fallback, explicit "API unavailable" UX, or feature-flag-disable behavior.
- **Clerk role and PIN admin are independent auth systems.** ~~Decide before any "co-maintainer" scenario.~~ **Resolved 2026-05-17:** PIN scheduled for removal — see backlog entry "Remove PIN admin auth." Open follow-up: admin-promotion UI so Clerk users can be elevated without DB surgery.
- **No automated test suite exists.** Verification is manual + production smoke. Each shipped phase increases the regression surface. Decide when the cost/benefit flips — probably tied to either "first co-maintainer joins" or "Phase 2 starts touching renderer in non-obvious ways."
- **Horse dictionary: stay as `data/horses.json.gz`, or move to SQLite?** Raised by Clover 2026-05-17: *"now that we are doing an SQLite DB does the stand alone dictionary make sense or would there be potential upsides to moving the horses to a big kid database instead of a gzipped blob?"* The archived decision (stays a file) was made before SQLite entered the stack for poems; legitimate to revisit now.
  - **Stay-as-file upsides:** O(1) lookups via `word_index`; fast, working, well-understood. Easy to ship updates (replace the gz). Simple to reason about. matcher.py is built around it.
  - **Move-to-SQLite upsides:** ~30MB RAM × 2 gunicorn workers freed up; queryable on registry/country/birth_year (powers the 1.8 "contains horse" autocomplete and per-horse pages from 2.10 more naturally); FTS5 for fuzzy name search lands cleanly; overrides become tracked rows instead of an overlay JSON; dictionary updates can be incremental instead of SFTP-and-restart; the next-feature surface (per-horse stats from 2.12, on-demand PQ scrape cache from 2.7) wants something queryable anyway.
  - **Costs:** non-trivial surgery in `matcher.py` and the dictionary loading path; per-lookup DB overhead vs in-memory dict access (matcher does many lookups per submitted poem); harder dictionary-version rollback (was "swap a file"); needs a decision about whether the gz becomes the source-of-truth that gets re-imported, or the SQLite table becomes canonical.
  - **Decide:** before Phase 2.7 (on-demand PQ scrape with cache) or Phase 2.10 (per-horse browse pages) — whichever lands first — because both want queryable dictionary surface. Doesn't block 1.7–1.21.
  - **Clover's current lean (2026-05-17):** *"If it ain't broke let's leave it until we have a real need for the full DB."* Stay-as-file until a feature genuinely forces the question. Worth keeping in mind as new metadata features are added — if we keep accreting overlay JSON files alongside the gz, that's a signal the question is closer to live.
  - **Hybrid worth considering when the time comes:** dictionary for the hot matcher.py lookup path (stays O(1), low surgery), SQLite for query-heavy surfaces (browse filters, per-horse stats pages, override tracking with history). The two synced at app boot or via a build step. Note: `data/horse_overrides.json` is already a small overlay-on-the-gz, so the architecture is informally already hybrid; the open question is whether to formalize and grow that layer in SQLite.

### Bugs (small, drop into next available PR)

- ~~**`poems.lines_json` schema comment is outdated.**~~ Fixed 2026-05-22.
- **Admin PIN logout has no UI affordance.** Deliberately deferred — PIN auth is scheduled for full removal; no point adding a link for a deprecated path.
- ~~**Same-name horses all render with the first horse's URL.**~~ Fixed 2026-05-22 — render-time URL cycling.

## Decisions log

Pre-migration architecture and product calls. Each is labeled per the vocabulary in CLAUDE-REFERENCE.md. Most are tagged `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]` because they predate the new decision-tracking workflow; that label is honest about where the workflow started, not a judgment on the decisions themselves.

### Architecture · settled

- Domain `poet.horse` (only one for MVP) · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Hosting on Jon's radio-station VPS (`zap.rupture.net`); independent VPS only if traffic warrants · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Deploy: GitHub → VPS via GitHub Actions (1.23 ✅); `appleboy/ssh-action`, DEPLOY_SSH_KEY secret, full uv path · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Stack: Flask + Jinja + vanilla JS (no SPA) · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Datastore: SQLite (single file, FTS5 for poem search) for poems/users/tags/submissions · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Horse dictionary: static `data/horses.json.gz` (~30 MB) loaded at app start; not in SQLite (lookups O(1) via `word_index`, SQLite would add overhead) · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Auth: Clerk (Google live; other providers pending OAuth setup); free tier ≤10k MAU · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Anonymous flow: full tool access pre-login; localStorage for stable/drafts/prefs; anonymous poems permanently anonymous · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Poem IDs: UUID4 hex internal; 11-char base62 short code (`secrets.token_urlsafe(8)`, sanitized) for public URL `/p/<short>` · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Tag taxonomy: curated categories + admin-approved suggestions; MVP categories are Poem Type, Theme, Linguistic Features, Content Warnings · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Cross-posting: admin-flagged → queue → scheduled bots per platform. Same schedule fine for MVP; schema supports per-platform schedules · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- API: internal-only at launch; public exposure deferred to Phase 3 · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Editor UI: utilitarian + accessible (no body-part whimsy on editor chips); coat color + famous shimmer only. Phase 2.1 is the full rethink · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Display UI: two render paths — plain (default for accessibility / reduced-motion / explicit pref) and pasture (full decoration, default for permalinks) · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Favorites: Pasture (working storage, explicit add) and Save (blue-ribbon sentiment) are distinct per-user collections; both private; aggregates feed admin curation and popularity rankings only · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Print: two `@media print` stylesheets — plain (also `.txt` source) and Victorian broadsheet (also fancy image-card source) · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`

### Cross-cutting commitments

These bind every phase. Pulled forward from the pre-migration ROADMAP because they're load-bearing for future work.

- **Accessibility-first.** Keyboard-reachable, alt-tagged, `prefers-reduced-motion`-respecting.
- **No tracking.** No analytics SDKs, no third-party pixels, no fingerprinting. Self-hosted Plausible acceptable later if needed.
- **Plain-mode parity.** Every feature must work in plain (reader) mode. If a feature only exists in pasture mode, that's a flag to redesign it.
- **The dictionary stays a fact, not a vibe.** Don't filter horses by name appropriateness — moderation happens on poems, not the source data.
- **Admin work is rare and explicit.** Don't automate it; don't hide it behind heuristics. Curation is the product.
- **Web 1.0 ethos.** Static where possible, light JS, view-source-able.
- **No upvotes, no addictive engagement loops.** No thumbs-up affordance, no notification nudges toward more engagement, no leaderboard on the front page. Popularity *signals* (saves, ribbon counts, pasture-adds) may surface in deliberate, opt-in discovery contexts — e.g. "most saved poem about love" as a search filter, "most-ribbon-tagged horse" as a fun glimmer — but **never as the dominant frame of the site.** Rule from the 2026-05-17 product-spec interview: *"mechanical web-2 elements can exist in deliberate, opt-in discovery surfaces; they cannot become the dominant frame."* This supersedes the flat-no on surfacing in the archived ROADMAP.
- **UI vs display separation.** Functional UI utilitarian (color + grass only); whimsy lives in display surfaces or opt-in modes.
- **Tumblr is one connector among many.** Website is canonical; Tumblr work never on the critical path.

### Product · default calls flagged as overridable

- Counting feature kept at `poet.horse/count` with no redesign; Tumblr posting from there still works for admins · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Multi-format line breaks deferred; MVP encodes only `newline` breaks with a publish-time warning on empty lines (intentional vs strip) · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Old-poem import from `data/poems/*.json` and counting-horses Tumblr is best-effort one-shot; fresh start acceptable if conversion is messy · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Pre-1.2 strip-decoration decision **reversed post-ship** — decorated chips are the canonical default, plain is accessibility opt-in. Shipped reskin lives in Phase 1.6; final styling pass is pre-beta · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`
- Attribution ("After / Translation") is a per-poem flag (`inspired_by_text` + `inspired_by_url`), **not** a tag. Briefly seeded as a tag in 1.3, then pulled · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]`

### Pre-beta operating posture

- **Pre-beta: break freely (2026-05-19)** · `[Clover, explicit]` — until beta, Clover is the only user. Preferences can be erased, features can change, things can break. No one gets hurt and we fix it while laughing. Beta is the threshold where actual users arrive and normal care applies. Until then: move fast, don't over-engineer for stability, don't add migration shims or backwards-compat scaffolding just to protect data that doesn't exist yet.

### Migration session

- **Migration to claude-project-template adopted (2026-05-17)** · `[Clover proposed, Claude approved]` — running this session under MIGRATION.md. Confirmed: working in this worktree (PR up), deriving ROADMAP from CLAUDE.md structure, phase block reads "Migration" until step 8, Opus · high.
- **Metrics surfacing refined (2026-05-17)** · `[Clover proposed, migration session — supersedes archived commitment]` — the archived cross-cutting commitment said public engagement metrics were never surfaced. Refined position: surface in deliberate, opt-in discovery contexts; never as the dominant frame. See updated commitment above. Triggered by Q5 of the product-spec interview.
- **Ads / tracking distinction clarified (2026-05-17)** · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown, surfaced this session]` — the archived Phase 4.2 already permits polite Carbon-style banner ads; the cross-cutting "no tracking" rule applies to pixels / SDKs / fingerprinting, not to ads themselves. Default user-facing policy: "we may run ads but you can block them if you want, we don't go out of our way to hoover up your data but we are not the place to expect real privacy shields." Not new — formalizing what was implicit.
- **AI submissions out of scope (2026-05-17)** · `[Clover proposed, Claude approved]` — stated rule: "AI get the same restriction as under 13s — if you can successfully pretend to be an adult human there's nothing I can do to stop you but please behave and post good poems." The horse-name constraint does most of the enforcement work. Site does not attempt detection; rule is stated and the constraint is the filter.
- **No DMs, no comment sections (2026-05-17)** · `[Clover proposed, Claude approved]` — connection happens off-platform via profile external links. Reply-via-your-own-poem is the engagement model.
- **bs4 intentionally NOT in `requirements.txt`** · `[Clover proposed, Claude approved]` — used by `post_builder.py` (Tumblr NPF parsing) and `scraper.py`. VPS has bs4 installed out-of-band; local dev `.venv-local` has it via manual install. Rationale: "bs4 is used for scraping and database parsing, not a concern for what we are doing now and doesn't need to be in the dev deploy package." Do not "fix" by adding to requirements.txt as a fly-by cleanup. Revisit only if a feature outside scraper/Tumblr-NPF needs it.
- **Poem visibility via short-code obscurity** · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]` — drafts at `/p/<short_code>` are accessible to anyone with the URL. Short code is ~64 bits of entropy. Explicit MVP choice: privacy-through-obscurity, not access control. Revisit before any feature that auto-shares draft URLs.
- **Tumblr OAuth tokens stored unencrypted on disk** · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]` — `tumblr_tokens.json` plain JSON. Acceptable for hobby-tier risk; revisit if site scope grows or VPS environment changes.
- **Draft TTL: 1 hour, silent expiry** · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]` — drafts in `queue_handler.py` expire after 3600s with no UI warning or auto-save fallback. Known UX gap; auto-save to localStorage planned but unspecced.
- **Legacy utility files remain in repo root** · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]` — `scraper.py`, `build_db.py`, `build_famous.py`, `fix_single_letters.py`, `validate_links.py`, `prototypes/`, `tumblr-theme.html`, `poem_store.py` (dead, pre-SQLite). Not imported by the app. Move to `scripts/legacy/` (or delete `poem_store.py` outright) in a separate cleanup PR.
- **Dictionary load failure is silent** · `[pre-migration — provenance unknown]` — `matcher.py:57` falls back through rich → legacy → error-to-stdout, then continues with `dictionary.loaded = False`. Routes still work but search returns nothing. Add a startup health check / louder log before Phase 2.
